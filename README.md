# Final Project Description

The Corona virus pandemic was the biggest event globally this year. Many people got sick with minor symptoms, some ended up in the intensive care units (ICUs), and some portion of those infected died. It affected every aspect of everyone’s life: national borders closed, flights were suspended, schools closed, working from home was instituted, social distancing measures were put in place, in some countries face masks were required, and washing your hands often became a necessity.
- Why did the government adopt these measures?
- Did we do these things to protect ourselves? Or to protect the others? Why? How?

Recall all the information you received during the outbreak: news clips, infographs you saw in the newspapers, pictures, etc. Draw a Concept Map of how Corona virus spread, and what are believed to be effective preventive measures?

Among the information you received, try to identify one or few simple mathematical model(s) that were used to predict the outbreak and the effectiveness of the interventions. Try to explain those models. What do you think were used to make the predictions? What were the input variables? What were the output variables? What was the relationship or the equations in those models? Do you think they were good models (How do you determine if a model is “good”)? What do you think they missed? What do you think can be improved? Which information do you think was missing?
Compare your concept map with the observations you made in Walk and talk II: The places COVID-19 touched. Were your observation consistent with the “best” advise you would have given if you were the expert after studying these models?

# Start working on the project, including:
- Work on your own model:
	- Push your team's model(s) to GitHub and create multiple branches if you want to experiment with different versions.
	- Add issues to your own project. Practice other functions such as Pull requests, Fork, branches and Push if needed (optional). 
	- Please finish this by Jan 15 2021 to give other teams sufficient time to look at your model. 
- Examine/critique the other’s model:
	- The model that you will examine/critique will be your team number plus 1 (i.e. if you are in Team 1, you will be examining/critiquing Team 2’s model. For the last team, Team 18, you will be examining/critiquing Team 1’s model.) 
	- If you just want to download other’s model without making any changes, then you can just download and not do anything on GitHub. 
	- If you want to play with other team’s model and make changes, then you use Fork to copy other’s model (as you learned in the first video). 
	- In both cases, if you have questions about the other team’s model, you can use Issues to ask questions.
	- Keep developing your model based on questions/critics and finish the final model before the project deadline. 



# Resources for an easier start with modeling infectious disease
The SIR model is one of the basic models to capture the spread of disease. We listed some resources here to help you get started and you can find more on the internet. Feel free to use any models for your project. These are just some inspirations.

- A great resource to learn the SIR model visually. < https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown >

- This blog (with python codes) is focused on more elaborate variants of the basic SIR model. < https://towardsdatascience.com/infectious-disease-modelling-beyond-the-basic-sir-model-216369c584c4 >

- This blog (with python codes) is adding urban mobility to the basic SIR model and includes a more advanced model. < https://lexparsimon.github.io/coronavirus/ >
